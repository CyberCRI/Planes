# Planes


## Description of game
Game Category : Mobile Game

Motivation:
3% of the pilots worldwide are women… Except in India where up to 11.8% of the pilots are women. Talking about inclusivity in the worplace, it is one of the best examples of inclusivity at the work place that Indian players can relate to. 

With this game, I want to make people realise that they already have a good inclusivity level, at least in one field. I don’t want the game to patronize them, I want the game to make them curious about Indian Pilot and I want to give strong representation of an industry which give chance for everyone and still has as good result as possible. Also I want them to have people which suceeded to relate to.

Also I want them to have fun by playing on a multiplayer game.

In the game, there is two players who control a plane using the same phone.Both of them can choose a pilot, each by looking at the biography of the pilots, where they will learn how inclusive is the pilot sector is (world youngest comander is a indian woman pilote, first all woman crew ...)

Then they play, two player by phone playing using the accelerometer.
